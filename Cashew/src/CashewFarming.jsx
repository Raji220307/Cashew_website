              Cashew farming involves cultivating cashew trees in tropical climates. The trees require well-drained sandy loam soil and plenty of sunlight. The farming process starts with seed germination, followed by careful planting, pruning, pest control, and harvesting the cashew apples and nuts.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted fs-6 fs-md-5">
              Farmers typically harvest the nuts during the dry season. After collection, the nuts are sun-dried and sent for further processing. This sustainable farming method provides livelihood to thousands of farmers and supports local agriculture.
